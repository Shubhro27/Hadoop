Book.xls structure:
	ISBN – ISBN identifier of the book
	BookTitle – title of the book
	BookAuthor - author of the book
	YearOfPublication – year in which book was published

	ImageURLL– the URL of large size image

Case Study questions:
1) Create a database(library), table(myBooks) and describe the table.
	CREATE DATABASE shubhro_library;

	USE shubhro_library;

	CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS myBooks(ISBN STRING, BookTitle STRING, BookAuthor STRING, YearOfPublication STRING, Publisher STRING, ImageURLS STRING, ImageURLM STRING, ImageURLL STRING)
	ROW FORMAT DELIMITED
	FIELDS TERMINATED BY '\;'
	tblproperties ("skip.header.line.count"="1");

	DESCRIBE myBooks;

2) Load the data into the table myBooks.

	LOAD DATA LOCAL INPATH 'attachment_Dataset_Books.xls' OVERWRITE INTO TABLE myBooks;

3) Find the unique books titles.

	SELECT DISTINCT(BookTitle) FROM myBooks;

4) Find how many books are published in every year.
	SELECT YearOfPublication, COUNT(*) FROM myBooks GROUP BY YearOfPublication;
	
5) Find the books that have been published more than once.
	Approach1:
	CREATE TABLE book_list (book_name STRING, book_count INT)
	ROW FORMAT DELIMITED
	FIELDS TERMINATED BY ","
	LINES TERMINATED BY "\n";
		
	INSERT OVERWRITE TABLE book_list SELECT BookTitle,count(*) FROM myBooks GROUP BY BookTitle;

	SELECT book_name FROM book_list WHERE book_count > 1;

	Approach 2:
		SELECT BookTitle, count(*) as bk_cnt FROM myBooks GROUP BY BookTitle HAVING bk_cnt > 1;
		
	Output:
		"Angels &amp    3
		"James and the Giant Peach"     2
		"The Firm"      2
		"The Perfect Storm : A True Story of Men Against the Sea"       2
		"The Tortilla Curtain"  2

	Question: whenever I am creating a table from other table, the field delimiter is limited to "\t" and not "," as I specified?
	
6) Find the top five publishers.
	Approach 1:
		CREATE TABLE publisher_list (publisher_name STRING, book_count INT)
		ROW FORMAT DELIMITED
		FIELDS TERMINATED BY "\t"
		LINES TERMINATED BY "\n";

		INSERT OVERWRITE TABLE publisher_list SELECT Publisher, count(*) as pub_cnt FROM myBooks GROUP BY Publisher ORDER BY pub_cnt DESC;
		select * FROM publisher_list LIMIT 5;

	Approach 2:
		SELECT Publisher, count(*) as pub_cnt FROM myBooks GROUP BY Publisher ORDER BY pub_cnt DESC LIMIT 5;
		
		O/p:
		"Ballantine Books"      22
		"Pocket"        16
		"Perennial"     10"
		Berkley Publishing Group"      10
