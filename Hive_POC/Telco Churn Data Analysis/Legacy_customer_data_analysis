Possible Exploration idea:
1. Display average bill (Total charges) paid by male and female. 
	
	INSERT OVERWRITE DIRECTORY '/apps/hive/warehouse/sb_proj1_telco_churn.db/AVG_BILL' 
	SELECT ROUND(AVG(TotalCharges),2) FROM telco_churn_table;

2. Display the most frequently used payment method a male.

	INSERT OVERWRITE DIRECTORY '/apps/hive/warehouse/sb_proj1_telco_churn.db/PAY_METHOD_BY_MALE' 
	SELECT PaymentMethod,COUNT(*) as payCount FROM telco_churn_table 
	WHERE gender = 'Male'
	GROUP BY PaymentMethod 
	ORDER BY payCount DESC;

3. If the customer is not having any internet connection then what is
the minimum bill that the customer has paid.

	INSERT OVERWRITE DIRECTORY '/apps/hive/warehouse/sb_proj1_telco_churn.db/MIN_BILL_FOR_NO_INTERNET' 
	SELECT MIN(TotalCharges) FROM telco_churn_table WHERE InternetService = 'No';

4. Count the number of senior citizen who have dependents (i.e. 1) and give
   them 20% discount on final bill and marked them as 'Sr Discount'.

	INSERT OVERWRITE DIRECTORY '/apps/hive/warehouse/sb_proj1_telco_churn.db/SENIOR_CITIZENS_WITH_DEP'
	SELECT COUNT(*) FROM telco_churn_table WHERE SeniorCitizen !=0 AND Dependents != 'No';

	INSERT OVERWRITE DIRECTORY '/apps/hive/warehouse/sb_proj1_telco_churn.db/SENIOR_CITIZENS_WITH_DEP_DISCOUNTED_BILL'
	SELECT *,ROUND((MonthlyCharges * 0.8),2)
	FROM telco_churn_table
	WHERE Dependents != 'No' 
	AND SeniorCitizen != 0;

5. Display customer id and their tenure whose tenure is more than 20 years
   and are using paperless billing method to save an environment
   
	INSERT OVERWRITE DIRECTORY '/apps/hive/warehouse/sb_proj1_telco_churn.db/CUST_20_YR_PAPERLESS_BILL_LIST' 
	SELECT customerID,tenure FROM telco_churn_table WHERE tenure > 20 AND PaperlessBilling = 'Yes';

6. Which is the most preferred internet service used by the customer, is it for Fibre optic or for DSL?

	INSERT OVERWRITE DIRECTORY '/apps/hive/warehouse/sb_proj1_telco_churn.db/PREFERRED_INTERNET_SERVICE' 
	SELECT InternetService,COUNT(*) as serviceCount FROM telco_churn_table 
	WHERE InternetService != 'No' 
	GROUP BY InternetService
	ORDER BY serviceCount DESC;

7. Customer who are using Streaming movies option. Calculate its final bill by increasing the monthly bill by 9.5%

	INSERT OVERWRITE DIRECTORY '/apps/hive/warehouse/sb_proj1_telco_churn.db/STREAM_MOVIES_ADD_BILL' 
	SELECT *,ROUND((MonthlyCharges * 1.0095),2) AS newMonthCharge, ROUND((TotalCharges * 1.0095),2) 
	FROM telco_churn_table
	WHERE StreamingTV != 'No';
